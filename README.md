# Get Started
## Train
**step1: get your dataset ready and implement the class under the folder `datasets/`**

**step2: revise the code in `config/train_config.py`**

**step3: run the script `train.py`.**

You could simply run:
```
python train.py train
```

If you'd like to change the params when you run the script, you could try:
```
python train.py train --epochs=300
```

This works because we used the library `fire`.

## Attack

**step1: make sure you have trained a model and saved the checkpoints**

**step2: revise the code in `config/attack_config.py`**

**step3: run the script `attack.py`.**

You could simply run:
```
python attack.py attack
```

If you'd like to change the params when you run the script, you could try:
```
python attack.py attack --defenses="['jpeg-filter']" --attack_name='mim'
```
